    <p>Please read these Terms carefully. By using iRecognize or signing up for an account, you're agreeing to
      these Terms. This is a legal agreement.</p>

    <p>We'll start with the basics, including a few definitions that should help you understand this agreement.
      iRecognize (“iRecognize” or the “Service”) is an email service offered through the URL <a
          href="http://www.iRecognize.org">www.iRecognize.org</a> (we'll refer to it as the “Website”) that allows
      you to create, send, and manage email newsletters (each message is called an “Email”) to individual
      recipients. iRecognize is owned and operated by FaradayCode, LLC d/b/a iRecognize, a California
      limited liability corporation (“iRecognize,” “we,” or “us”). iRecognize has employees, independent
      contractors, and representatives ("our Team"). As a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity
      that's a customer of the Service, you're a “Member” according to this agreement (or “you”).</p>

    <p>These Terms of Use define the terms and conditions under which you're
      allowed to use iRecognize and how we'll treat your account while you're a Member. If you have any questions
      about our terms, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p></div>

      account that's not yours, and you'll resolve any account-related disputes directly with the other party. We
      decide who owns an account based on the content of the emails in that account, and if multiple people or

      are due for any month on the same date, or the closest date in that month, to the day you signed up with us
      and made your first monthly payment (the "Pay Date"). If you go over your sending limit and reach another
      pricing level, then you'll have to pay at the higher level on or before the next pay date. If the Term ends

      considered a Member, and other than the monthly payment requirement, all the terms of this Agreement will
      still apply to you. Email Credits for Pay as You Go (prepaid) accounts roll over and don't expire, but if

      information and authorize us to deduct the monthly charges against that credit card. You'll replace the
      information for any credit card that expires with information for a different valid credit card. Anyone
      using a credit card represents and warrants that he or she is authorized to use that credit card, and that
      any and all charges may be billed to that credit card and won't be rejected. If, for some reason, we're
